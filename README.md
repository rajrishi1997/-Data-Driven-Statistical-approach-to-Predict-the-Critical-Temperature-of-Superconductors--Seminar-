Guide: Prof. Hina Amol Gokhale, IIT Bombay  
Conducted an extensive literature survey on machine learning algos to model superconductivity based on features derived from itâ€™s chemical formula like thermal conductivity, atomic radius, electron affinity and atomic mass.  
Explored various challenges of multiple regression and XG boost models in predicting the critical temperature. Analyzed the variance explained by the models and compared them on the basis of R2 score and MSE metrices
